# DiscordBot_fistik



It is basic discord bot that can response some simple comments, and play video from youtube. User can add multiple links or videos to queue using "!play xxx" command.

Good or bad?
- It should dowload every video, when it's their turn
- I did not try to play video simultaneous in multiple servers. That may not work
- It does not work with playlist.


+ It dowloads fast so users do not wait long times( 2 sec to dowload 4mb ".mp3" file
+ After dowloading 3 videos in "mp3" format it deletes first one and dowloads new ones so it requires less storage
+ Users can add videos to queue, skip them or stop it. Similiarly, users can pause and resume videos which are just in mp3 format.
